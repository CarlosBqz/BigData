### What is pair coding?
Pair programming consists of two programs that share a single workstation (a screen, keyboard, and mouse between the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the "controller", the other, is also actively involved in the programming task, but is more focused on the general direction is the "browser"; Programmers are expected to switch roles every few minutes or so.

**Common mistakes**

● Both schedulers must actively participate in the task during a paired session; otherwise, no benefit can be expected.
● At least the driver, and possibly both programmers, are expected to keep an active comment on what they are doing; Pair programming is also "programming out loud": if the driver is silent, the navigator must intervene.
● Pair programming cannot be fruitfully imposed on people, especially if relationship problems, including more mundane ones (such as personal hygiene), get in the way; these must be resolved first.

**Benefits**

● Better dissemination of knowledge among the team, particularly when a developer who is not familiar with a component is paired with one who knows it much better.
● Better transfer of skills, as junior developers acquire micro-techniques or broader skills from more experienced team members.
● Higher code quality: "Code out loud" leads to clearer articulation of the complexities and hidden details in coding tasks, reducing the risk of errors or falling into dead ends.

**Conclusion**

In my opinion, pair coding or pair programming is an effective method so that the skills or knowledge to be acquired when developing software is mutual. The objective of this practice is to share knowledge between both programmers, taking advantage of the fact that each one dominates different aspects when developing, in this way if one is not familiar with any function of the language this could be supported by his partner and in turn acquire a new skill. Another aspect that I managed to understand from this practice is that while you share knowledge with a development partner, you are learning how to make your code understandable not only for you, but also for other people who are going to edit / read it.

On the other hand, I think that this practice would be much more efficient if there was contact in a classroom with the assigned classmate, since in this way the communication between the two will flow better in person than when communicating via social networks.
