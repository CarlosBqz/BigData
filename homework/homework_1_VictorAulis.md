What is pair programming?
----------------------------

The method known as pair programming is used mainly in agile software development and, more specifically, in
extreme programming (XP). Pair programming specifies that there are always two people working on the code at the same time and that, as far as possible,
feel together. One is in charge of writing the code and the other of monitoring in real time. At the same time, they are constantly exchanging impressions:
they discuss problems, find solutions and develop creative ideas.

Typically, these two workers are assigned different roles: the programmer who has been assigned the pilot role is responsible for writing the code.
The programmer who has been assigned the copilot role supervises that code. One of the rules of pair programming states that these two roles are
exchange regularly (at short intervals). In this way, a possible hierarchical gap is avoided: equality between both workers is promoted and an i
nfluent role swapping.

**Good practices in pair programming**

In practice, this is usually a collaboration between two developers with different degrees of experience: thus, a more experienced worker can transmit
your knowledge to your younger peers directly through practice. For his part, a younger worker may come up with other ideas,
perhaps more innovative, which can contribute to the project..

Advantages and disadvantages of pair programming
---------------------------------------------------

Working as a couple within the framework of a project, whether it involves scheduling or another procedure, carries with it many advantages. As usual,
four eyes see much more than just two: the pair programming method minimizes the risk of errors. While one person writes the code, the other person
visualizes and concentrates only on finding errors. In general, it is quite difficult for us to detect the errors themselves. They are usually our companions
who detect them more quickly.

Another of the great advantages derived from communication is the constant development of creativity: the constant exchange that occurs between the couple of
programmers bring up ideas that might not be had if the job were individual. Intercom also ensures that problems can be solved
better in less time. Well, while a person who works alone may feel satisfied with the first option that seems best to him, the people involved in the pair
programming should always justify their decisions to others. It is possible that they have another perception of the problem and are not satisfied with the solution that is given to them.
proposes. This generates a debate in which new ideas are often presented that lead to a much better code.
