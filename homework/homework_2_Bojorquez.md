### What is Pearson's correlation coefficient?

The ** Pearson correlation coefficient ** is the standardized covariance, and its equation differs depending on whether it is applied to a sample, sample Pearson's coefficient (r), or if the population population Pearson's coefficient (ρ) is applied.

**Terms**

● The relationship to be studied between both variables is linear (otherwise, the Pearson coefficient cannot detect it).
● The two variables must be quantitative.
● Normality: both variables have to be distributed in a normal way. Several texts defend its robustness when the variables are moderately far from normal.
● Homoscedasticity: The variance of Y must be constant throughout the variable X. This can be identified if in the scatterplot the points maintain the same dispersion in the different areas of the variable X. I have not found this condition mentioned in all the books.

**Features**

● It takes values ​​between [-1, +1], with +1 being a perfect positive linear correlation and -1 being a perfect negative linear correlation.
● It is an independent measure of the scales in which the variables are measured.
● It does not vary if transformations are applied to the variables.
● It does not take into account that the variables are dependent or independent.
● Pearson's correlation coefficient does not equal the slope of the regression line.
● It is sensitive to outliers, so it is recommended, if it can be justified, to exclude them from the analysis.

**Interpretation**

In addition to the value obtained for the coefficient, it is necessary to calculate its significance. Only if the p-value is significant can it be accepted that there is a correlation and this will be of the magnitude indicated by the coefficient. No matter how close the value of the correlation coefficient is to +1 or -1, if it is not significant, it must be interpreted that the correlation of both variables is 0 since the observed value may be due to chance. (See below how to calculate significance).

**Conclusion**

What I understood about Pearson's correlation coefficient is that it helps us identify the relationship between two quantitative variables, that is, two variables that are linearly related. An example of the use of this coefficient is when seeking to identify the relationship between weight and height or, in a known case, the relationship between the number of shots and the percentage of a basketball player's goal.
